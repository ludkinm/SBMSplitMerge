# SBM SplitMerge
This repo contains the source for the SBMSplitMerge R package for performing inference on the number of blocks and the edge-state parameters in a Stochastic Blockmodels using a split-merge sampler.
This allows for inference in non-conjugate edge-state models.

This repo also contains the examples and data application scripts to reproduce the plots in the accompanying paper on ArXiV.
